#
# some bugs found or developments that can be made to the code
# 1. should add function to prevent click highscore during quiz or before input initial, actually crashed if clicked during the quiz ...
# 2. should check if the input of the initials is valid
# 3. the score might not be right... should probably add more if statement to make it more acturate
